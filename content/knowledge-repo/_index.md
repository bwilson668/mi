The knowledge repo is home to collections of domain terminology, data science concepts, and code snippets.

It is meant to:

- be a common dictionary for you, your team, and leadership
- save you time from looking up what that acronym means ... again
- provide some standardization to perform common *(boring)* tasks

No one can remember it all, but you don't have to.

Google can help you find an answer, but takes some digging.

Save time and get answers relevant to **your team**.
